It's a new dawn for performance & accessibility, but raises another question? How should we host the server component? Can we do that without vendor lock-in?\nEnter FABs, a portable, compact, immutable, server-side JS format that lets you deploy anything from static sites or Next.js to full custom server-rendered React apps anywhere that can run JS, like Cloudflare Workers, Lambda@Edge, Now, etc. Come check it out!"

Join me for a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to get the docs for a massively popular library translated.

First, an exploration of Observables at a high level, then a survey of use cases, followed by a dive into implementation details.

Numbers, booleans, logic, control flow, data structures… an arrow can do it all! In this session we'll live-code our way to a deeper understanding & admiration of the computational power of the lambda, an abstraction fundamental to functional programming."
